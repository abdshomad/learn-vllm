## 13 — Success Criteria and Final Artifacts

### Objectives
- Validate outcomes and collect artifacts for future reuse.

### Success criteria
- Two served variants: two models or one model with two LoRA adapters.
- p95 latency and tokens/s documented under typical load.
- Clients demonstrate streaming, retries, and batching.

### Required artifacts
- Benchmarks: CSV or Markdown table of latency/throughput across configs.
- Client wrapper code (Python and/or JS).
- One-command startup (script or service unit) and a short runbook.

### Final exercise
- Reproduce your best configuration from scratch and confirm all checks pass.

### Completion
- You are ready to operate a local, multi-GPU vLLM server with production-minded practices.
